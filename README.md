<p>The page is loaded and six random colors are here. These are always different.

One of those colors is listed up and job is to pick which one it is.

Remember that there are three channels red green and blue and each one ranges from 0 to 255 and all that we need are those three colors to make every single color that we could ever want.

Black, white, yellow, orange, purple all of those are actually made by combining red green and blue.
